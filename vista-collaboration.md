## VISTA Collaboration Framework

A  Collaborative Development, Testing, Documentation, and Deployment framework to accelerate the VISTA/M code lifecycle.

This framework modernizes the development lifecycle of VISTA/M, leveraging modern, collaborative, industry-standard,  web-based tooling and best practices.

* **Collaborative**:  Open, transparent, crowdsourced development and documentation maximizes quality and speed of both, and capability of VA to collaborate with all participants and stakeholders; and allows VA to expand the reach of contributors to a global network of experts and input.
* **Sole source of truth**
* **Version control** of all artifacts: code, documeentation
* **Testing**:  Continuous, test-driven design and coding will incorporate testing of:
* - M-Standards (SAC + ISO standard updated to 2015;  Enforced by XINDEX)
* - M Style  (Style guide shall be developed and validated;  Enforced by XINDEX)
* - M-Unit Framework (Shall be updated)
* - M-Status dashboard (web based dashboard shows status of all tests, issue,  and bugs; and link directly to the source code where the issue is)
* **Development**:  Real-time collaboration on M code development via Github
* **Documentation**:  Fully automated from markdown inline within source code; version controlled and crowdsourced on Github. Shall be indexed by keyword and subject headings; shall be 
* **Deployment**:  Framework for automating deployment of new code
*  - Patch Sequencer (automates the installation of any patch on any VISTA system based on patch history)
